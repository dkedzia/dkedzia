## Hi, I'm Dominik 👋

### About me

- 💻 **PHP/Backend developer from Kraków, Poland**
- 🌐 **Web-first** — I've worked on web, desktop, and mobile apps (.NET, Tauri/Rust, React Native), but my heart clearly beats for the web.
- 🧠 I care about understanding the **real problem behind the feature request**, not just ticking off tasks from a ticket.
- 🤖 I enjoy folding **AI tools** into my daily workflow and balancing speed with code quality.

### What I enjoy working on

- 🧱 **Refactoring legacy / spaghetti code** into cleaner architectures, including microservice-oriented setups.
- 🔧 **Migrating from “just a CMS”** to maintainable Laravel applications with a separate API for frontends, done step by step instead of big-bang rewrites.
- ⚙️ **Integrating external APIs**, automations and background workers.
- 🧪 Keeping code **covered with tests**, following PSR, and doing meaningful code reviews.

### Tech I use most

- 🐘 **Backend**: PHP 7/8, Laravel
- ⚛️ **Frontend (when needed)**: React, React Native
- 📦 **Dev/ops & tooling**: PHPUnit, Docker, Kubernetes

### Also worked with (commercially)

- ☕ Java
- 💼 C#
- 🐹 Go

*Not my main stack, but I’m comfortable enough to get things done when needed.*
